Regarding JDBC: Ive gone ahead and implemented JDBC support for my DAL objects, so it supports both file persistent storage and SQL databases. Say I want to have a config file for optionally switching between them or something like that, what would be the right approach in regards to the 3 layer architecture, anything to keep in mind?
