Regarding DAL layer: Would it be considered bad practice to use static functions and variables within this layer of the application?
... My thought was to avoid having to construct an instance and passing it around between functions, instead making it easier to manage code wise since I in this case have just one datastore to manage, so theres not really a need for, for example multiple instances?

Regarding exception handling: The IO exceptions that needs to be handled in terms of the DAL layer, should they be handled within the DAL layer or should I throw them and if so when should I catch it?
... Im thinking its best to catch the exceptions within the DAL layer itself and not throwing them further along?

Regarding storing the data in memory: Would this be considered acceptable to avoid reading the file each time I need the list, or should I go by reading the file each time?
